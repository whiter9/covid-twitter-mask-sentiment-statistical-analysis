Statistical analysis suite featured in the [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183863v3): Unmasking the conversation on masks: Natural language processing for topical sentiment analysis of COVID-19 Twitter discourse (September 2020)
## Background
This notebook houses a series of statistical procedures used to analyze a dataset of Tweets with associated sentiment scores. The code was written as part of a sentiment analysis pipeline which was used in the Summer of 2020 to analyze public sentiment related to masks, as described in the [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.20183863v3). The original conceptualization of the Twitter data extraction pipeline used to acquire the data for this analysis, as well as the motivations for the data acquisition, is described in the [project repository](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter) from the RPI Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA). Those interested in regenerating the Tweet dataset decribed in the paper should see the associated [repository](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-masks-nlp) for a guide to setting up the data collection and analysis pipelne.

## Setup
This notebook is compatible for running in a knitr-enabled R environment; I recommend RStudio.
